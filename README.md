# Introduction 
The project aims to establish a data processing system to assist Bitcoin mining, with the workflow including:

1. Continuously obtaining real-time BTC price indicators and mining metrics (such as network difficulty and network hashrate) from external third-party APIs.

2. After acquiring and cleaning the data, storing the indicators in a local database.

3. Generating a flattened data table with a 5-minute granularity, containing the following indicators: BTC/USD price, network difficulty, and network hashrate.
